The "original" **SeedMint** was tinkered without any references or drawings at all, quite a while back. Just for the love of handcrafiting things that I consider useful.
But only recently somebody asked me, if i would make plans for such a Jig available,  so I thought if only one person would get value from this, it would have been worth while making those plans. This has also been the first time I have heared about [Blockmit](https://blockmit.com/english/guides/diy/make-cold-wallet-washers/ "blockmit.com") - quite ignorant as I'll admit..
Blockmit's a remarkably comparable design and I probably wouldn't have made the SeedMint if I had known about it.. :-)
The Jig is intended to be used with 2-3mm letter- and 4mm number punches on an M6 stainless steel washer with an outer diameter of 18mm.
Just use a screw and a nut to hold them together.

Any contribution and/or feedback is greatly appreciated.
